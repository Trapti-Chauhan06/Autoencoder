# Autoencoder
This project implements a fully connected autoencoder trained to reconstruct clean MNIST digits from blurred inputs.Problem Statement Handwritten digits are often degraded due to noise and blur.Tech Stack-Python, TensorFlow/Keras-NumPy-Matplotlib-SciPy(for Gaussian blur). Results: The autoencoder successfully reconstructs digits with high fidelity.
